Kubernetes supports autoscaling, By default, Kubernetes does not provide AutoScaling. If you need AutoScaling, then you have to create hpa(Horizontal Pod AutoScaling) and vpa(Vertical Pod
AutoScaling) objects.
● Kubernetes supports the autoscaling of the pods based on Observed CPU Utilization.

Scaling only supports Scalable objects like Controller, deployment, or ReplicaSet.
● HPA is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller.
● The Controller periodically adjusts the number of replicas in a replication controller or deployment to match the observed average CPU utilization to the target specified in
the manifest file or command.
