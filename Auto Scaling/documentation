Kubernetes supports autoscaling, By default, Kubernetes does not provide AutoScaling. If you need AutoScaling, then you have to create hpa(Horizontal Pod AutoScaling) and vpa(Vertical Pod
AutoScaling) objects.
● Kubernetes supports the autoscaling of the pods based on Observed CPU Utilization.

Scaling only supports Scalable objects like Controller, deployment, or ReplicaSet.
● HPA is implemented as a Kubernetes API resource and a controller.
● The Controller periodically adjusts the number of replicas in a replication controller or deployment to match the observed average CPU utilization to the target specified in
the manifest file or command.


To perform HPA, we need one Kubernetes component which is a metrics server. To download this, use the below command.
