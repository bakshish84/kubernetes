In Kubernetes, a Service is a method for exposing a network application that is running as one or more Pods in your cluster.
The Service API, part of Kubernetes, is an abstraction to help you expose groups of Pods over a network. Each Service object defines a logical set of endpoints (usually these endpoints are Pods) along with a policy 
about how to make those pods accessible.

Three types of servivces:
1. ClusterIP: Internal to cluster
2. NodePort: Listens on each node in the cluster.
3. LoadBalancer: Proisions external load balancer
