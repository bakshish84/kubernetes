Dameon set runs a copy of the specified pod on all nodes(or a specified subset of ) in cluster.
As nodes are removed from the cluster, those Pods are garbage collected. Deleting a DaemonSet will clean up the Pods it created.

Useful for applicartion such as:

1. Cluster Storage daemon
2. Log aggregation
3. Node monitoring
