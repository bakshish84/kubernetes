Probes are to investigate or monitor something and to take necessary actions

Health Probes:

Health probes monitor your Kubernetes applications and take necessary actions to recover from failure
To ensure your application is highly available and self-healing

Type of health probes:
1. Readiness ( Ensure application is ready)
2. Liveness ( Restart the application if health checks fail)
3. Startup ( Probes for legacy applications that need a lot of time to start)

Types of health checks they perform?
1. HTTP/TCP/command


Liveness Probe (Health Check)
1. It is rich feature in kubernetes that is used to check the health of your application.
2. By default doesnot check health check of applications we have to define the probe in manifest file to use this feature.
3. livenessProbe expects a 0 output which means the application is running perfectly. But if there is any other output except 0 then livenessProbe recreates the container and repeats the same process.
4. livenessProbe repeats the process after particular seconds or minutes(specified by you) to check the health of the application.
5. If there is a load balancer attached to multiple pods then, livenessProbe checks the health of the application and if the applicationâ€™s health check status is not healthy
then livenessProbe removes the particular pod from the load balancer and recreates the new pod and repeats the same process.
