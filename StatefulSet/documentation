A stateful set runs a group of pods, and maintains a sticky identity for each of those pods. This is useful for managing applications that need persistent storage or a stable, unique network identity.
Stetful set is the workload API object used to manage stateful applications.

If you want to use storage volumes to provide persistence for your workload, you can use a StatefulSet as part of the solution. Although individual Pods in a StatefulSet are susceptible to failure, the persistent Pod
identifiers make it easier to match existing volumes to the new Pods that replace any that have failed

StatefulSets are valuable for applications that require one or more of the following.

    Stable, unique network identifiers.
    Stable, persistent storage.
    Ordered, graceful deployment and scaling.
    Ordered, automated rolling updates.
