
Each tenant (pod) requires specific resources like CPU and memory to function:

Requests: This is the minimum amount of resources a pod needs to operate smoothly. Think of it as a guaranteed reservation for the pod.
Limits: This is the maximum amount of resources a pod can use. It acts as a safety cap to prevent any pod from consuming more than its fair share and disrupting others.

Resource Control: By setting limits, you prevent a single pod from monopolizing resources, which can lead to issues like out-of-memory (OOM) kills or CPU starvation.

A pod requesting more memory than is available will be killed due to an OOM (Out of Memory) error.
