Ingress is used for managing external traffic to services within the cluster.

Ingress helps to expose the HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside of the cluster.
Ingress enables Path-based and Host-based routing
Ingress supoorts load balancing and SSL termination

It redirects the incoming requests to the right services based on the Web URL or path in the address.
Ingress provides the encryption feature and helps to balance the load of the applications

Why do we use Ingress because the load balancer supports the same thing?

Ingress is used to manage the external traffic to the services within the cluster which provides features like host-based routing, path-based routing, SSL termination, and more.
Where a Load balancer is used to manage the traffic but the load balancer does not provide the fine-grained access control like Ingress.

There are 2 types of routing in Ingress:

1. Path-baswed routing: Path based routing directs traffic to different services based on path such as example.com/apple
2. Host-based routing: host based routing directs traffic to different services based on website's URL such as apple.example.com


To implement ingress, We have to deploy Ingress Controller. We can use Ingress controller according to our requirements.



# helm repo add ingress-nginx https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx
# helm repo update

# helm install nginx-ingress ingress-nginx/ingress-nginx --create-namespace --namespace ingress-nginx


# kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx
